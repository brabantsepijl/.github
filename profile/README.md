After such a brilliant edition of Paris-Roubaix with a thrilling battle between Mathieu van der Poel and Tadej Pogaƒçar, and an impressive Paris-Roubaix Femmes victory by Pauline Ferrand-Pr√©vot, the Spring Classics action continues on Friday with the men's and women's Brabantse Pijl.

Also known in French as La Fl√®che Braban√ßonne (The Brabant Arrow), the hilly race takes on the same climbs used in the 2021 UCI Road World Championships around Overijse, giving riders a smooth transition into the Ardennes Classics.

Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) makes his return to competition from a dark period of recovery after being doored over the winter and suffering nerve damage to his shoulder. Other contenders in the men's race include Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) and Tom Pidcock (Q36.5). In the women's race, Marianne Vos (Visma-Lease a Bike) is up against the likes of Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ) and Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-Protime)

The race will be available on several platforms across the world, with live streaming options as well. Read on for all the details on how to watch De Brabantse Pijl and De Brabantse Pijl Women online, on TV, and from anywhere.
